## Hello! My name is Aidan Ward, and welcome to my GitHub resume! 👋

I am currently completing my final year at Princeton University and plan on graduating this May with a Bachelor’s Degree of Science in Engineering. I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Robotics, and I am pursuing a career in software engineering with a specific interest in operating systems and embedded programming, robotics, and game development.

Across my experiences writing a thesis on operating systems for embedded processors, working on AWS Marketplace's Containers team, leading the Princeton University Robotics Club as one of its Co-Presidents after being on various robotics teams for many years, and creating multiple personal small-scale programming projects and game demos, I am constantly striving to learn more about the complex software needed to interact with hardware systems.
